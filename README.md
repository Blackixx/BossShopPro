# BossShopPro

BossShopPro is one of the most player-friendly and multifunctional GUI plugins ever! Say goodbye to all the annoying command- or signshops!
It can not only be used to create shops but for every kind of menu. Here are just a few examples:
* Shop (Buy or sell items)
* Kits
* A menu that allows players to execute commands with a simple click
* Server selector (when having multiple servers connected)
* Warp menu
