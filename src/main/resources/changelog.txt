v1.9.9 [ALPHA] USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!
For all of you who want to try out BossShopPro using Spigot 1.13.1, I decided to upload the current development build. 
Do not use this on a production server; it has not been tested well enough for that. Additionally a few changes and features
to make upgrading shops to 1.13.1 are still missing.

The current update will break existing ItemData, which includes:
* Many material names
* Durability: For example colored wool used to have "type:WOOL" and "durability:<wool subtype>".
Now instead there is a separate material name for every type of wool, for example "type:RED_WOOL"
* Enchantment types
* Potion effect names

What I will work on within the next weeks:
* Thorough testing
* Fix small issues (for example RewardType enchantment seems to no longer detect the item in the players main hand)
* Wiki updates; links to the new ItemData names; Showing how mob eggs can now be setup without external plugins like SilkSpawners/EpicSpawners
* A command / script, which converts ItemData to 1.13.1, using the new names (will work for most but not all items)
* A BossShopProConfigure update
* Addon updates
* More testing
* Change color of glass pane in main menu

*[NOTE] Requires at least Spigot 1.13.1 If you use an older Spigot version simply use BossShopPro v1.9.7 or older.
*[UPDATE] Updated to Spigot 1.13.1
*[ADD] Added support for a list of options within numerical conditions when using the "equals" tag. Example:
    Condition:
    - type:RealWeekDay
    - 'equals:1,3,5'


v1.9.8
*[UPDATE] Updated EpicSpawners support

v1.9.5
*[NOTE] 1. The addon ThirdCurrency needs to be updated if you are using it

*[FIX] When using Language Utils item placeholders did not show the item quantity


v1.9.2 [BETA]
*[ADD] Added a possibility to define multiple prices with different pricetypes and multiple rewards with different rewardtypes per item
For more information check out https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bossshoppro-configuration-advanced-options -> Different RewardTypes/Pricetypes for one item.
Note: The new (advanced) price and rewardtypes are not supported by the setup tool and need to be configured manually.


v1.9.1 [BETA]
*[WARNING] Support for material ids, enchantment ids and potion ids will be removed soon and is no longer guaranteed. For more information check out https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/minecraft-1-13-what-to-expect.288714/. Every id can be replaced by the correct material/enchantment/potion name. This harsh step might break existing shops and require them to be modified. If you decide to update make sure to test your shops before making them public to your players.

*[IMPROVE] Numerical conditions now support placeholders, which can be used instead of fix values (for example using 'over:%priceraw%')
